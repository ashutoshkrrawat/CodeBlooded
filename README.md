#  CrisisLens by Team < CodeBlooded />

A unified platform that connects **NGOs**, **Donors (Users)**, and **Government Bodies** to enable **transparent, data-driven, and urgent humanitarian response** using **Artificial Intelligence**.

> **Theme:** AI for Social and Economic Good

---

## 🚀 Overview

This platform leverages **real-time disaster intelligence**, **machine learning**, and **secure financial infrastructure** to:
- Detect and analyze crises automatically
- Identify NGOs that need funds the most
- Enable direct, transparent donations
- Ensure accountability through AI-verified reporting

Our goal is to **bridge the gap between crisis detection, resource allocation, and impact transparency**.

## 🧠 Core Features

### 1️⃣ AI-Powered Crisis Detection & Analysis
- Scrapes **live disaster-related news** from trusted sources like **Economic Times**
- Extracted data is passed through an **ML pipeline** to generate:
  - Severity score
  - Risk factor
  - Urgency level
  - AI-generated reasoning & explanations
  - Geographical coordinates (latitude & longitude)
- Uses **Hugging Face Transformers** and **Gemini API** for enhanced NLP understanding

✅ Output is structured, explainable, and location-aware

---

### 2️⃣ Smart NGO Prioritization & Donations
- Detected crises are mapped against:
  - NGO location
  - Available funds
  - Crisis severity
- NGOs are **ranked based on urgency and need**
- Donors can:
  - View AI-recommended NGOs
  - Donate directly using **Razorpay payment gateway**
  - Ensure funds reach the most impacted organizations

💡 Data-driven donations instead of guesswork

---

### 3️⃣ Transparency & Impact Verification (In Progress)
- NGOs can submit **work reports** for specific crises
- Reports include:
  - Images as proof of work
  - Location metadata
- AI-based verification:
  - Image tampering detection
  - AI-generated image authenticity checks
  - Location verification to match crisis area

🔒 Ensuring trust, accountability, and transparency
