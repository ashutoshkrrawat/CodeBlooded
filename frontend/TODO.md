# To keep in mind:

- Use SHADCN UI as much as possible
- Use toasts for notifications etc
- Use Spinner/Loader in each page
- What about the state management
- Add favicon and title in index.html
- Look into nested routes
- Fix all the broken import/export statements
- Add usable fetch, post/put/delete hook
- Learn about git branch, PR, fork, restore, merge
- Never, ever push .env
- Add a global Error handler
- Use format
- Setup sockets in frontend
