- Test verifyAccessToken.js
- Test verifyAccessToken.middleware.js for sockets

## To be taken care of:

- All the utility functions, response handling, error handling and async handler
- Use of prettier to format before any commits (npm run format)
- Configure mongodb atlas to use the server from any where
- Use constants code for HTTP status code
- Add documentation for all the API routes inside the api.md and Postman as well
- Always add cookieOptions.js from the constants when setting any cookies!!!
- Make the limit of the accessToken very large
- Put the frontend link in .env by seperating it from commas in CORS_ORIGIN
